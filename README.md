# javascript-calculator

## About

This is my second portfolio project for the _nology consultancy course. This project was designed to demonstrate knowledge od JavaScript and integrating it with HTML and CSS.

The requirements for this project were as follows:

- Build a working calculator using HTML, Sass, and JavaScript
- The project should be managed with Git and hosted on GitHub Pages
- Use BEM naming in conjunction with Sass for readability in styling
- A minimum of 15 commits should be made to the repository
- Accept a minimum of 2 inputs on which to perform an operation and return the output
- Do **NOT** use the eval() function
- Take a mobile first approach
- When copying code from sources online: **if you can't explain it, you can't use it**
